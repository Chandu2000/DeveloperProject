💡Inspiration💡
We were inspired to create ConnectMatters after realizing that the year 2020 was a significant shift in the way companies operated. All teams went from a bunch of teammates working side by side in the office every day to sending emails and scheduling video chats from afar almost overnight. While they continued to perform great implementations and provide excellent support to clients, they lost a lot of the connection and togetherness that they used to have in the office. Our new work-from-home lifestyle hampered cooperation, and this hampered collaboration stifled invention. Also, this had been difficult for new workers working remotely at the company to reach out to people who could assist them. That made us realise how serious a corporate issue it is to lack an organised approach for employees to seek assistance.

We utilise ConnectMatters to create, cooperate, and reach out to the highest levels of businesses to effect change. This will not only increase employee involvement but will also improve employee satisfaction, raise awareness and, most importantly, develop a better community in which a company operates. It's a platform where any employee can submit new ideas to the company and have a say in how those ideas are implemented where Ideas are accessible for collaboration and voting, with the potential for genuine change.

💥Agora Voice Chat: We have used Voice Mod Extension and Bose noise cancellation along with implementation of Polls and Voting Feature.💥

As developers, we know how challenging it can be to build stable, performant applications as quickly as the business demands. It’s especially hard without visibility into how team works or tools to help us improve. LinearB goes beyond “data-driven insight” and offers an approach to improving dev team collaboration by using automation to eliminate annoying tasks. We connected LinearB to your Git instance and it Turn on Slack/MS Teams alerts to help you stay on track. We’ve got personal as well as team-level alerts.

🏗What it does🏗
The employee must first register by entering information such as their Name, Employee Id, Email Address, and Password. They can log in with their email and password provided during registration after completing the registration process. After logging in, We offer a platform where any employee may submit an Idea case to propose something new to their company. An idea could be as basic as a new team-building activity or as sophisticated as a proposal to use new technology/protocols or execute a new hiring strategy. The post-creation process is straightforward, allowing people to concentrate on their ideas rather than a confusing interface. They only need a name for their idea and a brief explanation to get started. We first need to choose categories, such as Ideas, Suggestions, Complaints, and Queries Details. They must then provide a description of the category they have chosen.

While the Idea is the heart of the application, the focus is on collaboration. When an idea is created, it becomes accessible to everyone in the company. The concept can now be followed and worked on collaboratively. In each case, users are urged to leave comments, upvotes/downvotes, and thoughts so that the creator can extend and improve their original concept.

Trending tags and ideas/issues based on category bring users up to date in real-time on their peers' actions, allowing them to investigate ideas as they are submitted. After an idea has gone through the collaboration process, the owner is ready to bring it up for voting, which will encourage more participation and company involvement. This can truly help newbies get involved and informed about what's going on in the company without feeling overwhelmed.

🔥How we built it🔥
The robust, aesthetically pleasing interface of ConnectConcerns was built with HTML/CSS/JS and is powered by Agora, LinearB, NetFoundry, and Lumigo.

🛑 Challenges we ran into🛑
Our team began working on the hack a day before the deadline, and we ran into some difficulties while tackling numerous problems. Learning how to work with various technology came with a learning curve. We have ideas for other features that we'd like to include in the future, but we wanted to make sure that what we had was production-ready and had a pleasant user experience first.

🏆Accomplishments that we're proud of: 🏆
We completed the front-end and backend of the programme within the tight deadlines we were given, and we are quite pleased with the final outcome.

💭What's next for ConnectMatters💭
As a team, we will make every effort to guarantee that our employees are satisfied and that all of their concerns are resolved. Different approaches and processes are used by different organisations, and our platform will adapt to this reality in the near future. Administrators will be able to impose sophisticated voting mechanisms without requiring changes to the development process.
